## The Dashboard

The dashboard shows the progress of each team during the current event. As of
2023, three types of dashboard are available:

- The "combined dashboard" shows all teams as one list. The line fills up as the
  team progresses along the stations. If the team arrived at a station, the line
  is lightly/faintly colored. If the team has finished the station, it will be
  fully colored.

  - The "Overall Progress" shows the combined progress of all teams. When this
    bar fills up, the event is over.
  - "Finished" and "cancelled" teams will be moved to a separate section.
  - The colour of the line represents the "route".

- The "separate dashboard" is similar to the "combined dashboard" but it shows
  one section for each route.

- The "legacy dashboard" contains information on each station, including state
  icons.

  ::: admonition warning
  Because station ordering on the "legacy dashboard" depends on route, the order
  in which the icons will update may be confusing.
